# Use case: Predict accident severity at each output area (LSOA) given datetime and driving conditions
<b>We will be looking at one Police Force to start with and only retain a few features based on our use case:</b><br>
<br>
<em>Given date, time, weather, light and road conditions, predict accident severity within the operating geographic area of a police force</em> <br>
<br>
<b>The deliverable is a tool that should faciliate ressource allocation and mitigate the probability of serious accidents given current driving conditions</b>
