# UK Road Safety: Traffic Accidents and Vehicles
This repository contains files produced for my IBM Coursera Advanced Data Science Capstone Project

## Datasource
Detailed dataset of road accidents and involved vehicles in the UK (2005-2016)<br>
<U>https://www.kaggle.com/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles#Accident_Information.csv</U>
    


## Use case
<b>Predict accident severity at each output area (LSOA) given datetime and driving conditions</b>
<b>For each Police Force we build a prediction model with the following objective:</b><br>
<br>
<em>Given date, time, weather, light and road conditions, predict accident severity within the operating geographic area of a police force</em> <br>
<br>
